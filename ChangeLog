	* gmx4.0-6 release
	* changed naming scheme slightly to indicate the major Gromacs
	  release that the code is supposed to work for
	* resolved name clash on newer Ubuntus (dprintf --> dbgprintf)
	  (patch contributed by Jayne E Wallace)
	* added INSTALL instructions and LICENCE
	* added 'check' target to Makefile

	* g_flux.c (Module): 
	  - additional functionality in g_flux: event log that records
            whenever a particle spent time in the cavity; includes both
            successful transitions and sojourns.
	  - FIXED: index of atoms that crossed had residue numbers and not
	           atom numbers; thus it could not be used as a normal
	           index file
	  

Previous changes:
	
g_count-gmx4.3

        * Added back g_zcoord and removed cruft; otherwise like gmx4.2.


g_count-gmx4.2

        * alpha release (quick hack so that it works with Gromacs 4.x),
          use at own risk and report bugs

        * Can only count atoms, not molecules.

        * g_flux should now count particles only inside the cylinder;
          this did not work before but all options to this effect were
          silently ignored. Tyically only matters for systems that are
          not embedded in an impenetrable membrane.

        * g_zcoord not supported; use the standard g_traj -nox -noy
          -ox coord.xvg for the basic functionality.

        * Changed numbering scheme to
          "gmxGromacsMajorVersion.g_countVersion"; this should show
          immediately which version of Gromacs is required for
          compilation.

g_count-0.3
        * This is the version that is documented in the appendix.
        * Note that g_flux silently ignores the -R radius option.

Earlier versions of g_count are functionally identical to g_count-0.3
but compile against earlier versions of Gromacs. See the README.
